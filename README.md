This is my repository for the independent research project for GG4257: Urban Analytics as a Toolkit for Sustainable Development. 

# Reproducing the Code

This section introduces how to replicate the code and how to get the required data. The code used to produce these maps can be found in a separate jupyter notebook called Code_Final_Assessment.ipynb. While it generally follows the structure outlined in the methodology, under each figure in the report, the code corresponding to its creation will be hyperlinked and highlighted in the table of contents on the left of your screen for ease of reproducibility and transparency. 

Moreover, the notebook will also be published on my Github Repo under the GG4257_Final_Assessment folder. The data necessarily to reproduce these maps will also be uploaded to a google drive folder. Moreover, the data necessary to reproduce this will also be made avaiable in a folder called "data" uploaded to this report.
